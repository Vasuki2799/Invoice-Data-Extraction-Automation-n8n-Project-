# Invoice Data Extraction & Automation (n8n Project)

This project demonstrates how to **automate invoice data extraction** using **n8n**.  
A sample invoice PDF is processed via the **OCR API**, and key details are automatically logged into **Google Sheets**.

## ðŸ”¹ Project Workflow
**Workflow Nodes Used:**
1. **Manual Trigger** â€“ starts the workflow manually for testing.  
2. **HTTP Request** â€“ sends the sample invoice PDF URL to OCR API (`https://api.ocr.space/parse/image`).  
3. **Code (JavaScript)** â€“ extracts key fields (Date, Vendor, Amount) from the OCR response.  
4. **Google Sheets (Append Row)** â€“ stores the extracted details in a sheet.
